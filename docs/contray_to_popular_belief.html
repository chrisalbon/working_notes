            <p>Lorem Ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The same logic applies when it comes to presentations, layouting websites or prototypes. Thus, in some cases, lorem ipsum refers not only to the need for filler text, but also to the need for non-distracting elements within a design.</p>
                <p>In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to be made and presented with the actual content still not being ready. <del>Think of a news blog that's filled with content hourly</del> on the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by <em>comprehensible content</em>, like readable text. <strong>Hence</strong>, a <a href="#" class="wiki-link">Link</a> ipsum approach is used to focus on the design, not the content.</p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, e.g., typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.</p>

            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, <mark>consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.</mark> This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum serves as a text placeholder for those who are focusing on the visual aspects of a document or presentation rather than the content itself. This practice helps ensure that the overall design, typography, and layout are visually pleasing before the final content is ready. Despite its nonsensical nature, Lorem Ipsum text has a rich history rooted in classical Latin literature. Its use in the design and publishing industries as a placeholder text has become a standard practice, allowing for a focus on design elements and layout rather than the text content.</p>
